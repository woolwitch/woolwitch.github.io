- [API Security](#api-security)
- [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration)
- [Sensitive Data Handling](#sensitive-data-handling)
- [Security Checklist](#security-checklist)

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- **Email/Password**: Managed through Supabase Auth with secure password hashing
- **Google OAuth**: Production uses real OAuth, development uses mock authentication (localhost only)
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens managed by Supabase with secure httpOnly cookies

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Admin privileges checked via `user_roles` table, NOT from JWT claims
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data access at database level
- Admin-only operations protected by both client-side and database-level checks

**Security Notes:**
- Mock authentication is ONLY enabled when both conditions are met:
  1. `import.meta.env.DEV === true` (development mode)
  2. Supabase URL contains 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'
- Production deployments must set `VITE_APP_ENV=production` to disable mock auth

## Payment Processing Security

### PCI Compliance
- **No Card Data Storage**: Card details never touch our servers
- **Stripe Elements**: Card input handled by Stripe's PCI-compliant iframe
- **PayPal Integration**: Payments processed entirely through PayPal's secure checkout

### Payment Data
- **Stored Data**: Only payment intent IDs, last 4 digits, and card brand
- **NOT Stored**: Full card numbers, CVV codes, Stripe client secrets
- **Encryption**: Payment metadata stored as JSONB in PostgreSQL with encryption at rest

### Payment Validation
```typescript
// Amount validation (£0.01 - £1,000,000)
if (amount <= 0 || amount > 100000000) {
  throw new Error('Invalid payment amount');
}

// Email format validation - robust regex preventing consecutive dots, 
// leading/trailing special characters, and invalid domain formats
const emailRegex = /^[A-Za-z0-9]([A-Za-z0-9._%-]*[A-Za-z0-9])?@[A-Za-z0-9]([A-Za-z0-9.-]*[A-Za-z0-9])?\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$/;
if (!emailRegex.test(customer_email)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid email address');
}
```

## Data Protection

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with granular policies:

**Products Table:**
- Public: Read access for all users
- Admin Only: Create, update, delete operations

**Orders Table:**
- Users: Read their own orders only
- Admin: Read/write all orders
- Anonymous: Create orders during checkout (user_id = null)

**Payments Table:**
- Access controlled via orders table relationship
- Payment details visible only to order owner or admin

### Sensitive Data Storage
**DO NOT STORE:**
- Stripe client secrets (temporary, not persisted)
- Full credit card numbers
- CVV codes
- Raw passwords (hashed by Supabase Auth)

**SAFE TO STORE:**
- Payment intent IDs
- Last 4 digits of cards
- Card brand (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- PayPal transaction IDs
- Encrypted payment metadata

## API Security

### CORS Configuration
**Development:**
```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'http://localhost:5173',
  'http://localhost:3000',
  'http://127.0.0.1:5173',
  'http://127.0.0.1:3000'
];
```

**Production:**
Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:
```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://woolwitch.com,https://www.woolwitch.com
```

### Rate Limiting
- Implemented at Supabase Edge Function level
- Protects against brute force and DDoS attacks
- Configure via Supabase project settings

### Input Validation
All user inputs are validated:
- Email format validation
- Payment amount bounds checking
- Required field validation
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Public Variables (prefix: VITE_):**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key (safe to expose)
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe public key
- `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID_*` - PayPal client IDs
- `VITE_APP_ENV` - Application environment

**Private Variables (server-side only):**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret key (NEVER expose to client)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (admin scripts only)

### .gitignore Configuration
Ensure these patterns are in `.gitignore`:
```
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
*.log
```

### Netlify Secrets Scanning

Netlify automatically scans build output for exposed secrets. The `netlify.toml` configuration allows specific Supabase keys that are safe to expose:

```toml
[build.processing.secrets]
  omit_keys = [
    "VITE_SUPABASE_URL",
    "VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
  ]
```

**Why this is secure:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is the **anonymous/public key** designed for client-side JavaScript
- This key is **protected by Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in the database
- Supabase specifically documents this key as safe to expose publicly
- See [Supabase API Keys Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#api-url-and-keys)

**Important:** Never add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `omit_keys` - this must remain secret!

## Sensitive Data Handling

### Console Logging
**Development Only:**
```typescript
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  console.error('Error details:', error);
}
```

**Production:**
- No sensitive data logged to console
- Generic error messages shown to users
- Detailed errors logged server-side only

### Error Messages
**Bad (exposes internals):**
```typescript
throw new Error(`Database error: ${error.message} in table ${table}`);
```

**Good (user-friendly, secure):**
```typescript
throw new Error('Failed to process your request. Please try again.');
// Log details server-side only
```

### Image Upload Security
- Maximum file size: 50KB (enforced at storage bucket level)
- Allowed types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Images compressed before upload
- Virus scanning via Supabase Storage policies

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables in the `woolwitch` schema have Row Level Security enabled:

- ✅ `woolwitch.products` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `woolwitch.user_roles` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `woolwitch.orders` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `woolwitch.order_items` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `woolwitch.payments` - RLS enabled

### Permission Model

The database follows the **Principle of Least Privilege**:

| Role | Products | Orders | Payments | User Roles | Admin Functions |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| `anon` | SELECT (via RLS) | INSERT (own orders) | INSERT (own payments) | ❌ | ❌ |
| `authenticated` | SELECT (via RLS) | SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE (own) | SELECT/INSERT (own) | SELECT (own) | ❌ |
| `admin` (via is_admin()) | ALL | ALL | ALL | SELECT | ✅ |
| `service_role` | ALL (bypasses RLS) | ALL | ALL | ALL | ✅ |

### Security Functions

#### `woolwitch.is_admin()`

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION woolwitch.is_admin() RETURNS boolean
  SECURITY DEFINER
  STABLE
  SET search_path = woolwitch, auth;
```

**Security Properties**:
- `SECURITY DEFINER` - Runs with elevated privileges to check user_roles table
- `STABLE` - Allows query optimization, safe because role doesn't change during transaction
- Limited search_path - Prevents SQL injection via schema manipulation
- Only returns current user's admin status (RLS prevents access to other users)

#### `woolwitch.handle_new_user()`

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION woolwitch.handle_new_user() RETURNS trigger
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = woolwitch, auth;
```

**Security Properties**:
- Auto-assigns 'user' role to new signups
- Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate roles
- Includes error handling to avoid breaking user creation
- Logs warnings for debugging without exposing sensitive data

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Methods

1. **Email/Password** - Standard Supabase Auth
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
   - Password reset via secure email tokens
   - Email confirmation disabled for local development

2. **Google OAuth** - Third-party authentication
   - Production: Real Google OAuth via Supabase
   - Development: Mock authentication for testing
   - Redirect URL validation enforced

### Authorization Levels

1. **Anonymous Users**
   - Can view available products
   - Can create orders and payments (checkout without account)
   - Cannot access other users' data

2. **Authenticated Users**
   - Can view their own orders and payment history
   - Can view all available products
   - Can manage their profile

3. **Admin Users**
   - Full access to all products (including unavailable)
   - Can view all orders and payments
   - Can manage products (create, update, delete)
   - Can upload/delete product images

### Admin Role Assignment

Admins are assigned via database:

```sql
UPDATE woolwitch.user_roles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@example.com');
```

**Security Notes**:
- Admin status is NOT in JWT claims (prevents token manipulation)
- Admin status checked via database query on each auth state change
- RLS policies enforce admin checks at database level

---

## Payment Security

### PCI-DSS Compliance

**Card Data Handling**:
- ✅ We do NOT store full credit card numbers
- ✅ We do NOT store CVV/CVC codes
- ✅ We do NOT store card expiration dates
- ✅ Card data is handled exclusively by Stripe Elements (PCI-compliant iframe)
- ✅ Only last 4 digits and card brand are stored (allowed by PCI-DSS)

**Stored Payment Information**:

```typescript
// Stripe payment details stored in database
interface StripeDetails {
  payment_intent_id: string;      // Stripe payment identifier
  payment_method_id?: string;     // Stripe payment method ID
  last_four?: string;              // Last 4 digits of card (PCI-compliant)
  card_brand?: string;             // Card brand (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
  // client_secret: NEVER STORED   // Intentionally excluded for security
}
```

### Payment Processing Flow

1. Customer enters card details in Stripe Elements (secure iframe)
2. Stripe creates payment intent (handled by Supabase Edge Function)
3. Payment confirmed with Stripe
4. Only payment metadata stored in database (no card details)
5. Order created with reference to Stripe payment_intent_id

### PayPal Security

**Stored PayPal Information**:

```typescript
interface PayPalDetails {
  paypal_order_id?: string;
  payer_id?: string;
  payer_email?: string;           // Minimize retention, consider masking
  transaction_id?: string;
  capture_id?: string;
  gross_amount?: number;
  fee_amount?: number;
  net_amount?: number;
}
```

**Security Considerations**:
- `payer_email` contains PII - should be masked or minimized in retention policies
- PayPal transaction IDs used for refund processing and audit trails
- All PayPal data protected by RLS policies

### Stripe Edge Function Security

File: `supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/index.ts`

**Security Features**:
- CORS headers properly configured
- Stripe secret key stored in Supabase Edge Function secrets (not in code)
- Amount validation required
- Customer email validation required
- Error messages sanitized to prevent information leakage

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Never commit these to git!
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # Stored in Supabase Edge Function config
```

---

## Data Protection

### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

The following PII is collected and stored:

| Data Type | Location | Purpose | Retention | Protection |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Email | `orders.email`, `auth.users` | Order communication, account | Indefinite | RLS policies |
| Full Name | `orders.full_name` | Shipping label | Indefinite | RLS policies |
| Shipping Address | `orders.address` (JSONB) | Order fulfillment | Indefinite | RLS policies, JSONB |
| Payment Email | `payments.paypal_details` | PayPal audit | 90 days* | RLS policies |
| Card Last 4 | `payments.stripe_details` | Customer reference | Indefinite | RLS policies, PCI-compliant |

\* _Recommended retention policy - not yet automated_

### GDPR Compliance

**Rights Supported**:

1. **Right to Access** - Users can view their order history via Orders page
2. **Right to Erasure** - Admin can delete user data (manual process)
3. **Right to Portability** - Order data available via API (authenticated users)
4. **Right to Rectification** - Users can contact admin to correct data

**Data Processing Basis**:
- **Contract Performance** - Order fulfillment requires shipping address
- **Legitimate Interest** - Payment records for accounting and fraud prevention

**Privacy Policy**: `/privacy-policy` page documents data collection and usage

### Data Encryption

**At Rest**:
- Database encryption provided by Supabase (AES-256)
- Backup encryption enabled
- Storage bucket files encrypted

**In Transit**:
- HTTPS enforced for all API requests
- TLS 1.2+ for database connections
- Supabase handles certificate management

**Application Level**:
- No additional encryption implemented for database fields
- Sensitive data protected by RLS and access controls
- Consider adding field-level encryption for highly sensitive data in future

---

## Access Control

### Storage Bucket Security

Bucket: `woolwitch-images`

**Policies**:
```sql
-- Public read for product images
CREATE POLICY "Public read product images" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'woolwitch-images');

-- Admin-only upload (prevents abuse)
CREATE POLICY "Admin upload product images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'woolwitch-images' AND woolwitch.is_admin());

-- Admin-only management
CREATE POLICY "Admin manage product images" ON storage.objects
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'woolwitch-images' AND woolwitch.is_admin())
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'woolwitch-images' AND woolwitch.is_admin());
```

**Security Features**:
- File size limit: 50KB (prevents large file uploads)
- Allowed MIME types: Only image types
- Public read, admin-only write
- Direct URL access for performance

**Previous Issue (Fixed)**:
- ❌ Previously allowed all authenticated users to upload
- ✅ Now restricted to admins only

### API Access Control

**PostgREST API**:
- Max rows per query: 1000 (prevents DoS)
- RLS enforced on all queries
- JWT validation required for authenticated endpoints
- Schema isolation prevents cross-application access

**Anonymous Access**:
- Limited to read-only operations on public data
- Order creation allowed (checkout without account)
- Rate limiting recommended (not implemented)

#### User Roles Table

| Policy | Role | Operation | Condition |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Users view own role | authenticated | SELECT | `user_id = auth.uid()` |

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to git (`.gitignore` configured)
   - Use `.env.example` as template
   - Supabase secrets for production credentials

2. **SQL Migrations**
   - All migration files include `woolwitch_` prefix
   - Use parameterized queries (Supabase client handles this)
   - Test migrations on local database before deploying

3. **Code Review**
   - Security-sensitive changes require review
   - Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Verify RLS policies before deploying

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular `npm audit` for vulnerability scanning
   - Update dependencies quarterly (or when security patches released)
   - Pin major versions to prevent breaking changes

---

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures

**If a security vulnerability is discovered**:

1. **Assess Severity**
   - Critical: Data breach, exposed credentials, RLS bypass
   - High: Privilege escalation, DoS vulnerability
   - Medium: Information disclosure, missing validation
   - Low: Minor information leakage, non-exploitable issues

2. **Immediate Actions**
   - For Critical/High: Disable affected functionality if possible
   - Document the vulnerability and affected systems
   - Notify team lead/security contact

3. **Remediation**
   - Develop and test fix in local environment
   - Create migration if database changes required
   - Deploy fix to production
   - Monitor for exploitation attempts

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Document root cause and fix in security log
   - Update this documentation if processes changed
   - Consider if similar vulnerabilities exist elsewhere

## Automated Security Scanning

The Wool Witch project implements comprehensive automated security scanning through GitHub Actions workflows. Security scans run automatically and create issues when vulnerabilities are detected.

### Security Scanning Workflow

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Daily scheduled scan at 2:00 AM UTC
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Security Checks

#### 1. CodeQL Analysis
- **Purpose**: Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Query Set**: `security-and-quality`
- **Coverage**: Detects SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and other common vulnerabilities

#### 2. Secret Scanning
- **Tool**: TruffleHog OSS
- **Purpose**: Detect exposed secrets, API keys, tokens, and credentials
- **Verification**: Only verified secrets trigger failures
- **Scope**: Full repository history

#### 3. NPM Security Audit
- **Production Dependencies**: Fails on high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Dev Dependencies**: Monitored but doesn't fail workflow
- **Checks**: Known vulnerabilities in npm packages
- **Tool**: `npm audit` with JSON output analysis

#### 4. Dependency Review (PR only)
- **Trigger**: Pull requests only
- **Purpose**: Review new dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Fail Level**: High severity vulnerabilities
- **License Check**: Blocks GPL-2.0 and GPL-3.0 licenses

### Automated Issue Management

#### Issue Creation on Failure

When any security scan fails, the workflow automatically:

1. **Creates a GitHub Issue** with:
   - 🔒 Title: "Security Scan Failed - [Date]"
   - Detailed failure report including:
     - Workflow run link
     - Branch and commit information
     - List of failed security checks
     - Next steps for remediation
   - Labels: `security`, `security-scan-failure`, `automated`, `high-priority`

2. **Prevents Duplicate Issues**:
   - Checks for existing open security failure issues
   - Adds a comment to existing issues instead of creating duplicates
   - Each failure adds a timestamped comment with latest details

3. **Provides Context**:
   - Direct links to workflow run logs
   - Links to Security tab for detailed alerts
   - Specific remediation steps for each type of failure

#### Auto-Resolution on Success

When all security scans pass successfully:

1. **Finds Open Issues**:
   - Searches for issues with `security-scan-failure` and `automated` labels
   - Only processes open issues

2. **Closes Issues Automatically**:
   - Adds a success comment with timestamp
   - Closes the issue automatically
   - Includes link to successful workflow run

### Monitoring Security Scans

#### View Security Scan Status

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh workflow view security.yml

# List recent security scan runs
gh run list --workflow=security.yml

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>
```

#### Manual Trigger

```bash
# Trigger security scan manually
gh workflow run security.yml
```

#### View Automated Issues

Security failure issues are tagged with:
- `security-scan-failure` - Identifies security workflow failures
- `automated` - Indicates auto-created issue
- `security` - General security category
- `high-priority` - Requires immediate attention

Filter in GitHub Issues:
```
is:issue label:security-scan-failure label:automated
```

### Best Practices

1. **Monitor Daily**:
   - Security scans run daily at 2:00 AM UTC
   - Check for automated issues regularly

2. **Address Issues Promptly**:
   - Security issues are marked `high-priority`
   - Follow the remediation steps in the issue description
   - Link fixes to the security issue

3. **Review Before Merge**:
   - All PRs trigger security scans
   - Don't merge if security scans fail
   - Dependency review blocks vulnerable dependencies

4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**:
   - Run `npm audit` locally before committing
   - Use `npm audit fix` to auto-fix when possible
   - Review and update dependencies monthly

5. **Handle Secrets Properly**:
   - Never commit secrets to the repository
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Rotate exposed credentials immediately

### Security Scan Results

#### Successful Scan Output
```
✅ CodeQL Analysis: success
✅ Secret Scanning: success
✅ NPM Security Audit: success
✅ Security Status Check: success
```

#### Failed Scan Output
```
❌ CodeQL Analysis: failure
✅ Secret Scanning: success
✅ NPM Security Audit: success
❌ Security Status Check: failure
[GitHub issue created automatically]
```

### Permissions

The security workflow requires the following permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository code
  security-events: write  # Upload CodeQL results
  actions: read          # Read workflow results
  issues: write          # Create/update/close issues
```

### Integration with Development

#### Local Security Checks

Before pushing code, run local security checks:

```bash
# NPM audit (production dependencies only)
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high

# Full audit for visibility (includes dev dependencies)
npm audit

# Run linting and type checking
npm run test
```

#### CI/CD Integration

- Security scans run on every push to `main`
- Pull requests include dependency review
- Failed scans block merge (if configured as required check)
- Issues created automatically ensure visibility

---

## Future Security Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on order creation (prevent abuse)
   - Consider using Supabase Edge Functions with Deno KV for rate limiting

2. **Data Retention**
   - Automate deletion of PayPal payer_email after 90 days
   - Implement order archive after 7 years (accounting requirements)
   - Regular cleanup of abandoned carts

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
   - Monitor for unusual admin activity
   - Track payment failures for fraud patterns

4. **Additional Encryption**
   - Consider field-level encryption for shipping addresses
   - Encrypt PayPal payer_email if long-term retention needed

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Implement audit trail for admin actions
   - Log order status changes
   - Track product modifications

6. **Backup Security**
   - Regular backup testing
   - Encrypted backup storage
   - Point-in-time recovery procedures

7. **Security Testing**
   - Annual penetration testing
   - Automated security scans in CI/CD
   - Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
